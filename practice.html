    <p class="Artax-Lyrics">On a misty morning hop, a bun man named Artax did make a heckin stop<br>
       He thought he heard a familiar sound, and in that direction he began to bound<br>
       Near the water's edge he saw a sight, it was unusual but not a fright<br>
       It was cat named Sir Bartibus Rex, on this day he tried to flex<br>
       Sir Rex lept at Tax with a mean blow, but Taxman deflected, he was ready to row<br>
       Artax he did hop onto Rex's head and smashed in his fucking brains until Sir Rex was dead<br>
      For Artax did not play that punk shit, flex on me bitch and it's gonna get lit</p>
